                Hi there! Welcome to my super awesome, cool blog! I started this blog because I just really &lt3 HTML, and wanted
				to get some more practice using it! Yep, that's right, this entire blog is written 100% from scratch using nothing
				but my raw, untempered talent &amp also some guidance and lessons from the nice folks in the UCLA PIC department.
				</p>
				<p>
				Let me tell you about some of the interesting stuff I'm learning about in this class! Last week, we talked about how
				<b>black hat</b> programmers sometimes use HTML tricks to make their garbage pages show up more often in search engines,
				such as hiding common keywords in invisible text, while <b>white hat</b> programmers use other techniques to make
				legitimate webpages easier for users to find. This is really interesting! I started to daydream during class, imagining
				what this would look like...
				</p>
				<p>
				<i>A dimly lit room, full of men in dark sunglasses and black fedoras tipped low over their brows. The air is filled
				with nothing but the sound of keyboards tapping away, and cigarette smoke curling up through the air. Suddenly one of
				them stands up and shouts, "I got one! Some moron gave us their credit card info because this site didn't use 'rel=noopener'!"
				The room erupts in a raucous explosion of guffaws and snorting giggles. Suddenly, the door bursts open, and a bright
				light shines into the room, blinding the black-hatted men for a moment even though they're wearing sunglasses. A
				squadron of hackers in white tuxedos file into the room, tackling the black hats to the floor and setting up laptops
				to begin re-writing the evildoers' code. One man comes to the front of the room, and takes off a white cowboy hat,
				surveys the room with satisfaction, and declares, <strong>"You insects just got...DEBUGGED!"</strong></i>
				</p>
				<p>
				And before I knew it, class was over. Whoops, looks like I forgot to submit the participation assignment for class that 
				day. TA, if you're reading this, sorry about that. I <em>swear</em> I actually did it, I just forgot to turn it in. The 
				assignment for that day can be found <a href="AboutMe.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, if you really want 
				to read it. See you all later, blog!
                </p>
