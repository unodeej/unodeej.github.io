        <h3>Part 1: Birth of a Hero</h3>
        <p>
          I was born on January 22, 1998, in a hospital in Laguna Beach, California. My family lived in the 
          nearby city of Laguna Hills, where I lived for 18 years before moving to the city of Los Angeles,
          California.

        <h3>Part 2: No, Like Where Are You From?</h3>
        <p>
          As for where I'm <i>"from"</i> from, my great-grandparents were born in Japan. They moved to Hawaii
          to find work, where my grandparents on my mom's side were born. The two of them met there &amp got
          married, and moved to California, where my mom was born in Los Angeles.

      <h1>Why I'm taking PIC 40A</h1>
      <section>
        <p>
          As a Cognitive Science major with an emphasis in Computing, I am required to take a lot of the lower
          div PIC classes. However, I also want to learn how to code browser-based games from scratch!
