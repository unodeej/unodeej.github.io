Description: You have found yourself stranded on a satellite planet.  You are surrounded by strange, hostile aliens.  You are also armed with a gun.  Try not to die.  

Advanced Topic(s): Marching cubes, collision

Difficulties:
* Collision detection: collision demo was implemented in a hacky way: not good for other shaped objects
* 
* Terrain generator: keeping track of 2x2 array of chunks in xz plane, optimizing for load speed vs. load frequency
* Enemy movement: keeping enemies from crashing into each other, getting too close or too far from player
